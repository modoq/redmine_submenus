# Sub-Menus

Welcome to the Sub-Menus plugin for Redmine!

## Overview

The Sub-Menus plugin enhances your Redmine experience by adding intuitive dropdown menus to project and wiki titles. These menus provide an additional way to navigate through your projects and wiki pages alongside the traditional breadcrumb trail.
"While the breadcrumb trail guides you back home, Sub-Menus point you straight to the gingerbread house!"

## Installation and Configuration

### Installation
The Sub-Menus plugin is compatible with Redmine versions 4.0.X and above.

1. Download the plugin from [gitlab @ Departement of Psychology](https://gitlab.psychologie.uzh.ch/smisch/redmine_submenus).
2. Extract the plugin files to the `plugins` directory of your Redmine installation.
3. Restart your Redmine server.

### Configuration

Navigate to the Redmine administration panel. Open the configuration of the Plugin and activate/deactivate Sub-Menus for projects and wiki-pages. Adjust the dropdown menu symbol to align with your preferences.

## How to Use

- Navigate to a project to discover a dropdown menu next to its title.
- Any sub projects will be neatly displayed in this menu.
- Simply click on a sub project to navigate directly to it - landing on the previously active tab type.

- In the wiki section, you'll also find a dropdown menu next to the wiki page title.
- If the wiki page contains sub pages, they'll be listed in the dropdown menu.
